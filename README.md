# Kinect for Windows

Kinect is a motion sensing input device by Microsoft for the Xbox 360 video game console and  Windows PCs. Based around a webcam-style add-on peripheral for the Xbox 360 console, it  enables users to control and interact with the Xbox 360 without the need to touch a game  controller, through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands.The project is  aimed at broadening the Xbox 360's audience beyond its typical gamer base. Microsoft released  Kinect software development kit for Windows 7 in June, 2011. This SDK allows developers to 
write Kinecting apps in C++/CLI, C#, or Visual Basic .NET.

## Requirements

- Kinect for Xbox 360 / Kinect for Windows sensor
- Visual Studio 2013 Community update 5 [[download](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2013-community-vs#download-visual-studio-2013-community)]
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 
- Microsoft DirectX 9 or later

## Getting Started With Microsoft Kinect SDK 1.0

Kinect SDK includes drivers, rich APIs for raw sensor streams and human motion tracking,  installation documents, and resource materials. Kinect SDK is a freeware and can be  downloaded [[here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2013-update5-vs)]. 

## Install SDK

1. Make sure the Kinect sensor is not plugged into any of the USB ports on the computer.
2. If you installed a previous version of the Kinect for Windows SDK, you must uninstall it before proceeding.
3. Remove any other drivers for the Kinect sensor.
4. Close Visual Studio. You must close Visual Studio before installing the SDK and then restart it after installation is complete to pick up environment variables that the SDK requires.
5. Once the SDK has completed installing successfully, ensure the Kinect sensor is plugged into an external power source and then plug the Kinect sensor into the PC's USB port. The drivers will load automatically.
6. The Kinect sensor should now be working correctly.

## Testing SDK

1. Go to Start Menu  
2. Search for "Kinect SDK Sample Browser"
